# React
- making a new Component, React should be imported on the top
- only one component in one application
- but it's ok to import component to another component
- I can give properties(prop) to each components (it looks like HTML Tag)
- properties can be whatever, not only string, but boolean, array etc..
- and all of props is going to be argument of its function
- every component have to have unique key



# Java Script
- <array>.map( <function> { return ~~ }) 
- '.map' return new array of every component of <array> with things that you wanna put after return
